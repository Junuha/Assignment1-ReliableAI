Cloning the pre-trained parameters of a Diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion's latent UNet, (referred to as ‚Äútrainable copy‚Äù) while also maintaining the pre-trained parameters separately (‚Äùlocked copy‚Äù). It is done so that the locked parameter copy can preserve the vast knowledge learned from a large dataset, whereas the trainable copy is employed to learn task-specific aspects.\n",
        "2. The trainable and locked copies of the parameters are connected via ‚Äúzero convolution‚Äù layers (see [here](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet#controlnet) for more information) which are optimized as a part of the ControlNet framework.
